2. Visit the faucet interface (link to your deployed faucet or UI).

## Important Notes

- Goerli is a Proof-of-Authority (PoA) testnet primarily used for testing Ethereum applications.
- The Ethereum Foundation has announced plans to deprecate Goerli; consider using Sepolia for new projects.
- Testnet ETH has no real monetary value and is only for testing purposes.
- Always verify you are using official or trusted faucet services to avoid scams.
